Sure, you can get in touch!

I'm mindful that we all are at a point in the online era where different social networks are useful, useless, or overwhelming to each of us in different ways. While my preferred networks may not be yours, but that needn't be an obstacle to establish connection.

I'm on LinkedIn at [https://www.linkedin.com/in/xurizaemon/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xurizaemon/). If you message me on LinkedIn, I will probably see it in the next week or two.

I was on Twitter at [@xurizaemon](https://twitter.com/xurizaemon), but I kind of lost interest a year or two back. Not really recommended.

I am on the fediverse at [@xurizaemon@toot.cafe](https://toot.cafe/@xurizaemon).
