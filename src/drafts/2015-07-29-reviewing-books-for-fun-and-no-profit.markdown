I'm reviewing a second book, this time about CiviCRM. Not sure of the title yet but it's fairly specific section of the Dewey code I'm sure.

The company who has asked me to review it offers I think a free copy of the published book and another free book download. That is a pretty low cost for getting technical review on a book. They also want me to turn around chapter reviews in 2-3 days, which is more of an ask when you have a real life and you're being asked to review both the written and technical content of the book (does the code run? do the words line up and sound right?).

I enjoyed contributing to [Drush User's Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/drush-user%E2%80%99s-guide) earlier this year, and I learned a lot from reviewing the content so it wasn't all suffering, but I think the publishers can't expect too much quality from the review process with the parameters they set.

Mostly I just turn the review in when it's ready, which they seem to accept so far. That's what you get for rudely close to free :)

A useful thing I learned when reviewing though, is that making a check mark next to each paragraph actually seems to help me read and assess what I'm reading. Another small lesson from the world of education.

Interesting that when I reviewed the Drush book our team was doing daily standups, and this time we're not; last time I was keen to share all the new things I'd learned, and writing this I reaslied - I haven't even mentioned I'm reviewing another book, much less one in our specific sector.

I miss standups, and I miss team engagement.
