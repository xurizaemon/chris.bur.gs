Tena koe, I'm Chris, I guess this is a collection of things I am sharing.

I'm a Pakeha software developer and contributor who lives in ÅŒtepoti, Aotearoa.

I'm lately learning to play guitar and working on a garage to home office conversion.

In my work I'm Open Source Advocate and a Senior Developer at Catalyst IT in Wellington.

I maintain and contribute to a handful of [open source components](/projects/). I'm active in the Drupal community and will sit on the DrupalSouth Steering Committee from May 2023 for two years.
