Kia ora, I'm Chris Burgess.

I like to make mistakes and learn from them, to feel my way through new things, and I enjoy reflecting on how to make things better. I enjoy working with organisations who "do good" but I'm still working on defining exactly what that means.

I enjoy working with wood - currently trying my hand at smaller woodwork projects on the weekends, but chopping firewood is a favourite job too, and like most humans I enjoy sitting by a warm fire like I am as I type. I enjoy software too, and I've been working with online systems - publishing, commerce, data management since the late '90s.

I'm a parent of two sons,

I'm employed by [Fuzion](http://fuzion.co.nz), where my role is to assist organisations in their online work for political and social change. I work mostly with open source tools for online campaigning, especially Drupal and CiviCRM. I particularly enjoy working with JavaScript & Ruby; I get along fine with PHP too of course.

I was born in Auckland, and grew up playing on the slopes of Mount Hobson with views of the Waitemata harbour.

Today I live in Dunedin with my partner Saira Lal and two sons Hunter & Rowan.

Lifestyle is what brought us to Dunedin - in particular the freedom to commit to at least one fulltime parent while the boys were growing, and the spaciousness to walk the boys to school before work most mornings. Our families are still based in Auckland, and the call home is a strong and present theme.

I enjoy drawing (mostly contour, mostly humans), play futsal (goal) and am learning Tae Kwon Do with Hunter.

I'm interested in career opportunities and it's OK to contact me regarding them. If you have a great team environment & and you think I might be a good fit, get in touch.
