I've been gathering a bunch of reading on teams and figured I might collect some of it in a post.

## Who's in the room

- [Hire More Women In Tech](https://www.hiremorewomenintech.com/)
- [Gender Decoder](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/) and [JobLint](https://joblint.org/), tools to check your job listing for gendered smells
- There's more to consider here than gender!

## Interviewing

- [Culture Queries](https://www.keyvalues.com/culture-queries) - questions to ask if you're being interviewed for a position. Also if you're reflecting on your current environment.

## Getting Better

- [Career Ladders](https://career-ladders.dev/) by [@sarah_edo](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) & pals
- [progression.fyi](https://www.progression.fyi/)
- [Progression Podcast](https://www.progression.team/podcast)

## Values

- [Gitlab's Values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) - I love this, myself.
- [Github Values](https://www.keyvalues.com/github) - some good stuff here too, but Gitlab's resonates with me a lot more.
