I know it's pretty old news, but I just have to say that as someone who's messed around with hosts files and apache configs for some years now, I'm freaking love the convenience and lazy simplicity of [Pow](http://pow.cx/).

Even when it's just proxying back to LAMP apps, it's still saving me a bunch of effort. (I've automated that effort with .sh in the past, but Pow is just soooo easy.)
