It's Friday night, I'm delighted. Home and quiet, the fire warms the
room, it's midwinter cold outside. About a month ago I started working
for [Fuzion](http://fuzion.co.nz), run by a long-time colleague and
friend Peter Davis. I'm loving it - a great crew to work with, it
feels like a good fit.

Right now, my delight is 100% because I get to *leave work at
work*. I've always had a "protestant work ethic" thing going - I'm not
a particularly *hard* worker, mind - just kind of driven to work in
order to reassure myself that I'm doing my bit.

So tonight, I finished work around five, and then I went on a spree of
custom code removal (11K LoC gone in 1:15, yo - what a freaking mess
that was), and then I hopped the bus home. And I'm home, and putting
the kids to bed, and feeling absolutely healthy because I don't feel
like I have a pathological need to pick up some unfinished business
later on in the evening.

(Sorry, peeps with unfinished business, see ya Monday! Unless it's
urgent enough that you *really* need me. You've got my number.)

I love having a job. It took me a long time to realise it was a
healthy option for me.
