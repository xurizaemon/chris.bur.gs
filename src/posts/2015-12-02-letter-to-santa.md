Just a quick post 'cos I'm doing [#nzsecretsanta](https://nzsecretsanta.nzpost.co.nz/) this year and have been wishing my secretsanta recipient posted more about what they want. So here's me paying it forward by saying what I like/where I'm at!

Last year I got some Sharpie sunglasses and a set of a dozen Sharpies - I really enjoyed the strong bright tones of the pens, which went well with my contour drawing style and liking for strong blocks of colour.

In 2016 I will be -

* Crafting with wood (rediscovering this)
* Sketching
* Playing with technology lots
* Building (or finding) a team environment that supports ongoing learning
* Studying Mandarin (with Rowan, 6)
* Practicing Tae Kwon Do (with Hunter, 8)
* Riding bikes and playing outdoors with family
* Playing futsal / indoor netball / anything with balls
* [Watching blackbirds hatch outside our window](/blackbird-nestcam)

We're going up to Auckland in a few weeks, looking forward to a summer in the north.

Right now I'm building the 2016 election website for the Australian Green Party, enjoying working with the various tools in play. They have a great distributed team and a lively mix of skills on deck.

I may update this, it feels like a good "forward reflection" :)
