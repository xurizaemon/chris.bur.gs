Here's what it says about me, based on being fed a randomly handy post from this here blog.

> You are sentimental.
>
> You are empathetic: you feel what others feel and are compassionate towards them. You are proud: you hold yourself in high regard, satisfied with who you are. And you are assertive: you tend to speak up and take charge of situations, and you are comfortable leading groups.
>
> You are motivated to seek out experiences that provide a strong feeling of connectedness.
>
> You are relatively unconcerned with tradition: you care more about making your own path than following what others have done. You consider helping others to guide a large part of what you do: you think it is important to take care of the people around you.

I suspect it's probably fairly right, for the instance of me which existed while writing [that post](/foo), but these sweeping "you are X" claims seem to have all the credibility of this yellow machine at the Victoria Park Markets which took your DOB and spat out a page of dotmatrix horoscopic proclamations.

I kinda liked that machine too, and computers are pretty good at horoscopes anyway since it's just maths right? But I didn't *trust* it.
