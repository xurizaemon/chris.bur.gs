ContribLog ([adaptdk/contrib](https://github.com/adaptdk/contrib)) is a tool for capturing contribution records on the commandline.

On first run the user does some interactive setup of their organisation and first project. After that, users can select the project and interactively add contributions. Trying it out, it's a lightweight but manual method for capturing a personal record of contributions.

```

The file "contributions.yml" was updated correctly
```

On second run, we won't get so many questions:

```
www-data@ea69a85560cf:~$ ./contriblog add
[1/7] Which project received the contribution?
  [0] New project
  [1] dmore/behat-chrome-extension
 > 
```

And contributions are logged to a local `.yml` file:

```
www-data@ea69a85560cf:~$ cat contributions.yml 
organization:
    name: Catalyst IT
    url: 'https://catalyst.net.nz'
people:
    xurizaemon: 'Chris Burgess'
projects:
    dmore/behat-chrome-extension:
        name: 'Behat Chrome Extension'
        url: 'https://gitlab.com/behat-chrome/behat-chrome-extension'
        tags:
            - drupal

```

What I like about the tool is that it enables tracking of non-code contributions on an equal standing with code ones. This tool could suit CLI users if we asked staff to manually track contributions. It uses PHP, but could be packaged as a `phar` for distribution.

## Engari ko te raruraru

The chief challenge of this tool for me is ... it's a lot like timesheeting, right? Timesheeting is effort, and introducing a new task steals energy from other tasks. I sense anyone who's ever had to chase timesheets knows it's not reliable either.

That's why I think that if we can do so responsibly, we should prefer unobtrusive tools to gather data in the first instance, and bolster automated approaches with ways of capturing this information together - perhaps a discussion roundup at the end of the week, in which we might capture a handful of contributions. A team's `contriblog` output might be captured there and consumed by a tool like GrimoireLab.

There are some other challenges/opportunities too - eg I see that the contribution is associated with an individual in the example above? Perhaps the tool could push contributions entered to a centralised (organisation or community) service as well. The UX is that of a decent prototype and could be improved.
