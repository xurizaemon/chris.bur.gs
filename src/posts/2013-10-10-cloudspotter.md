`cloudspotter`

[A Cloudspotter Spottings tag on Github](https://github.com/xurizaemon/jekyll_cloudspotter_tag).

Might get pretty big - the list of images I mean, not the Jekyll plugin - so probably don't want this as a gallery so much as an ongoing stream. Will do for a first stab.

Should have called it "CLOUDTAG" though.

Based on [Thomas Mango's Flickr Set plugin for Jekyll](https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_flickr_set_tag).
