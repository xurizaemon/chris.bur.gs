A second survey, to follow [the first unscientific survey of NZ political sites](/posts/2013-04-06-unscientific-survey). On the eve of the Ikiroa-Rawhiti by-election no less.

I'm only following this up out of duty to my past and future selves, you understand. Also, it occurs to me that FPT probably offers a permalink to the report, and I could skip the images copypasta. But hey, consistency?

I am a little bit excited to see Mr Zeman's been busy putting together [Speedcurve](http://speedcurve.com), it looks pretty fab from the demo. Hi Mark!

EDIT: Oh dear! I forgot ACT existed both times I ran this survey. I'm belatedly adding them in third place below, well done Berend, fastest of the Drupal sites here.
