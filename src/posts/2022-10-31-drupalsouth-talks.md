I didn't make it to DrupalSouth this year sadly, but it sounds from some attendee reports like it was a tight conference and the industry is going great over the water. An interesting challenge of this is that Australia is in a hiring frenzy for Drupal folk, and it'll be a challenge for us to compete with that.

I applied to attend when my talk proposal was accepted, but was disappointed to find that there was no remaining budget for this.

Some good talks coming out on video now anyway! I get the impression that the Drupal industry is really moving ahead in Australia.

Keynote by Sarah Jane Peterschlingmann. Some good insights on team culture & development, particularly interesting to see her comments on how trying to improve team makeup using pay can have unintended consequences, and appreciated her articulation of the "expert leader" trap.
