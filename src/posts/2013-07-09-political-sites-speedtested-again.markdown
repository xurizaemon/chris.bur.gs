I'm not bored of this yet. I'm just getting started. Trying [WebPageTest.org](http://www.webpagetest.org/) this time to compare results - it isn't quite as pretty but I think it's more detailed.

Times are initial / second load. These results are substantially different to the previous two rounds.

## Labour

[1.871s / 1.270s.](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/130708_D0_Q89/)

## United Future

[2.876s / 1.094s](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/130708_1D_QAN/)

## Greens

[2.983s / 1.900s](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/130708_BX_QAY/)

## NZ First

[4.310s / 2.405s](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/130708_6H_QQY/)

## ACT

[6.545s / 4.272s](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/130708_3Z_Q8Z/)

## Mana

[7.514s](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/130708_KD_Q9C/) (did we lose the test machine with the initial load time?)

## National

[10.121s / 6.093s](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/130708_YF_QA6/)

## Maori

[14.619s / 4.078s](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/130708_D4_Q9S/)
